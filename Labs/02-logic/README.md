## 2. A 4-bit binary comparator

### Listing of VHDL architecture from design file:


### Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file:
```vhdl
architecture testbench of tb_comparator_4bit is

    -- Local signals
    signal s_a       : std_logic_vector(4 - 1 downto 0);
    signal s_b       : std_logic_vector(4 - 1 downto 0);
    signal s_B_greater_A : std_logic;
    signal s_B_equals_A  : std_logic;
    signal s_B_less_A    : std_logic;

begin
    -- Connecting testbench signals with comparator_4bit entity (Unit Under Test)
    uut_comparator_4bit : entity work.comparator_4bit
        port map(
            a_i           => s_a,
            b_i           => s_b,
            B_greater_A_o => s_B_greater_A,
            B_equals_A_o  => s_B_equals_A,
            B_less_A_o    => s_B_less_A
        );
```vhdl
